    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 5, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
        CarModo is designed with privacy-first principles. 
        <strong>We do not collect personal information such as name, email address, phone number, or location.</strong>
        The App does not require user accounts or manual registration.
    </p>
    <p>
        When using CarModo, users may upload photos of their vehicles to generate AI-powered car modification visuals. 
        The uploaded content is used solely to perform the requested generation task and is not used for identification, profiling, or tracking purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Image Data Usage and Processing</h2>
    <p>
        CarModo processes vehicle images provided by users to generate AI-based modification previews.
        Processing is strictly limited to visual transformation and generation requested by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        Image generation is performed using AI models including 
        <strong>Google Nano Banana, Nano Banana Pro, and Veo 3.1</strong>, 
        orchestrated via <strong>fal.ai</strong> and infrastructure services provided by <strong>Supabase</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Uploaded photos and generated content are stored to allow users to access their generated results.
        <strong>Generated images are retained for a maximum period of one (1) year.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is temporarily stored on <strong>Supabase infrastructure hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Asia Pacific – Sydney (ap-southeast-2)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users may permanently delete generated images at any time via the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the App.
        Once deleted, the content is <strong>irreversibly removed</strong> from our systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If the user does not manually delete the generated content, it is automatically deleted after one (1) year.</strong>
        This deletion includes removal from all processing and storage systems, including <strong>fal.ai</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>No image data is retained beyond this one-year retention period.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        CarModo uses the following third-party services strictly to operate core functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase</strong> – backend infrastructure and temporary data handling (AWS Asia Pacific – Sydney, ap-southeast-2)</li>
        <li><strong>fal.ai</strong> – AI image generation orchestration</li>
        <li><strong>Google AI models (Nano Banana, Nano Banana Pro, Veo 3.1)</strong> – AI content generation</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> – subscription and purchase management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>User images and generated content are not shared with third parties for advertising, marketing, analytics, or profiling.</strong>
        Data is transmitted only to the above services for the sole purpose of providing the requested AI generation.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payments and Subscription Data</h2>
    <p>
        All payments and subscriptions are handled securely through <strong>Apple In-App Purchases</strong> and managed via <strong>RevenueCat</strong>.
        <strong>CarModo does not collect or store payment details, billing information, or financial identifiers.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We apply industry-standard security measures to protect data during processing.
        <strong>Because uploaded vehicle images are deleted after a defined retention period, long-term exposure risk is minimized.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Users have full control over their generated content and may delete it at any time.
        Since all generated content is automatically deleted after one year,
        <strong>no additional deletion requests are required.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        CarModo is not intended for children under the age of 9.
        <strong>We do not knowingly collect data from children.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technical, or operational changes.
        Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
